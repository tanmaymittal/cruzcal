## What is CruzCal? 
A productivity tool for UC Santa Cruz students. CruzCal lets users select their Class and produce calendar files based on the class events they can import to their preferred calendar. Users will also be able to import this Calendar to Google Calendar (built-in OAuth Consent). 


## What is the goal? 
Help students save time! 


## How is this done? 
We scrape the information from PISA and essentially build our database of classes with regular updates to make sure class information is up to date. This database is then used to pull data whenever the user makes a request. We then use a calendar module to generate a .ics file or give the option to the user to log in with Google and add to their Google Calendar.
